## Aim ##

This is a website created for myself to showcase my photography works and projects which will be built later in the course. It also includes information on the services that I aim to provide as an all-in-one media solutions provider.

## UX/UI ##

This is a four page website, designed with the following in mind:

**Target audience**
* Potential employers
* Companies/Employers looking for freelancers
* Freelancers who are looking for collaborations on projects

**Users' needs**
* Website should be user-friendly
* Information should be upfront and concise

**Design**
* Minimalist
* Organized content 
* Pleasing colors

**User Stories**
1. To highlight the services that I aim to provide as an all-in-one media solutions provider.
2. To build a minimalistic website that is easy for users to navigate and to be able to draw users' attention to the services' information.
3. To build a website with a color theme that is inline with my photography works which mainly consist of sea and costal photos. 
4. To showcase my current skills utilizing HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap and other tools

## Features ##
* The navigation bar follows Bootstrap's breakpoints and is responsive for small, medium and large screens. The links in the navigation bar changes to a light grey color when hover over, to indicate that it is a link that user can click on which will bring them to another page of the website.
* **Home**  
The page features a hero image right below the navigation bar, followed by a write up on the services provided and a screenshot of a client's website.
A back-to-top button is provided at the bottom right to allow users to quickly navigate to the top of the page, without scrolling.
* **About Me**  
An introduction on my education background, work experience and skill set.
* **Photography**  
A gallery of some of the photos wich I have taken, with the location details.
* **Contact**  
A contact form to enable users to send me a message

Future features
* Add tags to the gallery items which can be used to search and filter the images.
